# TYR
**TYR** is a group of students that interest and spend time to learn AI. We currently being a students in [Universitas Negeri Semarang](https://unnes.ac.id/). **TYR** name was taken by separation of the main people that create this group.
- T stand for [Teguh](https://github.com/TeguhDcahyo)
- Y stand for [Yudha](https://github.com/yogaacor)
- R stand for [Rizqi](https://github.com/Kingki19)

## A brief background
We made this group while we do our ML (Machine Learning, not Mobile Legends) competition in Satria Data 2024 that held by education ministry. It seems that our university is lack for open organization that works in open development of AI. It's proven by that my lecturers (that we ask) didn't prepare any students competition candidate while us ask to join Satria Data in 2024 or Gemastik Data Mining 2024. Some organization is already made that very focus on a single competition like robotics or ship modelling or cars prototyping. But there's nothing that focus on AI. Our goal is to create an open public organization to put our code as an example of how AI works.

## Current progress
Our current works is:
- to finish scriptie draft for a reasearch methodology course;
- complete some competition,
- and prepare a bigger upcoming competition on 2025.
